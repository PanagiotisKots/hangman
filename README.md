Project Description:

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game built using Python and Tkinter, a GUI library for creating desktop applications. In this project, the player is tasked with guessing a randomly selected word by suggesting letters. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses (lives) before the game ends. The game is visualized using a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays the word to guess, tracks incorrect guesses (represented by hearts), and shows a drawing of the "hangman" figure that progressively builds with each incorrect guess.

The game allows the user to choose from three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, and Hard), which affect the number of incorrect guesses allowed and the duration of the game timer. If the player runs out of time or guesses incorrectly too many times, the game ends, and the word is revealed.
Features:

    Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game uses Tkinter to create a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with.
    Multiple Difficulty Levels: Players can choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty, each affecting the number of attempts and the game’s timer.
    Timer: A countdown timer is integrated into the game to add pressure. The game ends when time runs out.
    Hangman Drawing: A hangman figure is drawn incrementally as incorrect guesses are made, showing the player’s progress toward losing.
    Game Flow: The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or exhausts their attempts/time, showing the result with a pop-up message.

Code Explanation:

    Imports and Setup:
        Tkinter: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
        random: Used to randomly select a word from a list for the game.

    Class HangmanGameGUI:
        This is the core class that controls the entire game. It contains methods to handle the game’s flow, GUI updates, and game logic.

    __init__ Method:
        Initializes the game settings like the word list, attempts, timer, and difficulty level.
        Calls setup_menu() to display the initial game menu.

    setup_menu Method:
        Displays the main menu with buttons to select the difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard) and an exit button.

    start_game Method:
        Starts a new game with a randomly selected word from the word list.
        Initializes variables like guessed_letters, remaining_attempts, and display_word.
        Sets difficulty parameters (number of attempts and timer duration).
        Calls setup_game_gui() to transition to the game screen.

    setup_game_gui Method:
        Sets up the GUI for the game, including displaying the word (with underscores for hidden letters), remaining lives (hearts), and a timer.
        Also sets up buttons for input and game options (Restart, Main Menu).
        Creates a canvas widget to display the hangman scaffold and drawing.

    draw_base and draw_hangman Methods:
        draw_base draws the scaffold for the hangman figure.
        draw_hangman progressively draws parts of the hangman figure (head, body, arms, legs) as incorrect guesses are made.

    make_guess Method:
        Handles the player's guess. It checks if the guess is valid (a single letter) and updates the game state accordingly:
            If the guess is correct, it reveals the letter in the word.
            If the guess is incorrect, it reduces the number of attempts, removes a heart, and adds a part to the hangman figure.
            If the word is completely guessed, the game ends with a win message.

    update_word_display, update_hearts_display, update_guessed_letters:
        These methods update the word display, the hearts (lives), and the list of guessed letters after each guess.

    update_timer Method:
        Updates the countdown timer every second. If the timer reaches 0, the game ends with a time-up message.

    end_game Method:
        Ends the game, either when the player guesses the word or runs out of attempts or time. Displays a message box with the result and either shows the correct word or a loss message.

    clear_window Method:
        Clears all widgets (game elements) from the window, making it ready for the next screen (menu or game).

    Main Code Execution:
        The list word_list contains the words from which the game randomly selects.
        A Tkinter window (root) is created, and an instance of HangmanGameGUI is initialized.
        The mainloop method starts the Tkinter event loop, allowing the user to interact with the game.

Key Components of the Code:

    Word Selection: A random word is selected from a list for the player to guess.
    Input Validation: Ensures the player enters only valid guesses (single alphabetical letters).
    Game State Updates: After each guess, the display is updated to reflect the current state (word with guessed letters, remaining attempts, etc.).
    Visual Feedback: The hangman figure and hearts provide visual feedback on the player's progress and mistakes.
    Timer: A countdown timer adds urgency to the game, and it expires if the player doesn’t guess in time.

Conclusion:

This project demonstrates how to create a fun, interactive game using Python and Tkinter, focusing on core programming concepts like random word selection, input handling, GUI updates, and game state management. By adding elements like a timer and difficulty levels, the game provides a dynamic challenge that varies based on the player's choices. The graphical hangman figure provides a visual representation of the player's progress and makes the game more engaging.
